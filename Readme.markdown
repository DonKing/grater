# Grater

CSS grids as easy to use as a cheese grater.

Simply download [grater.css](https://github.com/samsoffes/grater/raw/master/grater.css) to get started. You can also install it as a gem if you are using Rails 3.1 or higher with the asset pipeline.

## Gem Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'grater'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

You may need to run `bundle update` since Rails comes with `sass-rails` which uses an older version of the Sass gem.

You can also install it yourself with:

    $ gem install grater

## Usage

Simply require `grater` like you would any other stylesheet using Sprockets.
